\par 
\par ### Why Three Licenses?
\par 
\par The zlib License could have been used instead of the Modified (3-clause) BSD License, and since the IJG
\par         License effectively subsumes the distribution conditions of the zlib License, this would have effectively
\par         placed libjpeg-turbo binary distributions under the IJG License. However, the IJG License specifically refers
\par         to the Independent JPEG Group and does not extend attribution and endorsement protections to other entities.
\par         Thus, it was desirable to choose a license that granted us the same protections for new code that were granted
\par         to the IJG for code derived from their software.
\par 
\par ### IJG JPEG Library License
\par 
\par In plain English:
\par 
\par We don't promise that this software works. (But if you find any bugs, please let us know!)\~
\par 
\par You can use this software for whatever you want. You don't have to pay us.
\par 
\par You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it in a program, you must acknowledge
\par             somewhere in your documentation that you've used the IJG code.
\par 
\par In legalese:
\par 
\par The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied, with respect to this software,
\par         its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose. \~This software is provided "AS
\par         IS", and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.
\par 
\par This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane. All Rights Reserved except as specified below.
\par 
\par Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software (or portions thereof) for
\par         any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions:
\par 
\par If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this README file must be
\par             included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to
\par             the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
\par 
\par If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation must state that "this
\par             software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group".
\par 
\par Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any
\par             undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
\par 
\par These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, not just to the unmodified
\par         library. \~If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.
\par 
\par Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name in advertising or publicity
\par         relating to this software or products derived from it. \~This software may be referred to only as "the
\par         Independent JPEG Group's software".
\par 
\par We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial products, provided
\par         that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the product vendor.
\par 
\par ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its
\par         copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and
\par         conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that you
\par         must include source code if you redistribute it. \~(See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.) \~However, since
\par         ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
\par         the foregoing paragraphs do.
\par 
\par The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free
\par         Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess,
\par         config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh). \~Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is also
\par         freely distributable.
\par 
\par It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&T,
\par         and Mitsubishi. \~Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses. \~For
\par         this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software. (Since arithmetic
\par         coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many
\par         implementations will support it.) So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
\par         code.
\par 
\par The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the
\par         Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to
\par         produce "uncompressed GIFs". \~This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are
\par         larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.
\par 
\par We are required to state that
\par 
\par ### The zlib/libpng License (Zlib)

\par             software. If you use this software in a product, an acknowledgment in the product documentation would be
\par             appreciated but is not required.

\par         distribution, modification, or other use of the TWAIN Toolkit.
\par 
\par As a condition of this license, Customer agrees to include in software programs based in whole or in part on the
\par         TWAIN Toolkit the following provisions in (i) the header or similar file in such software and (ii) prominently in
\par         its documentation and to require its sublicensees to include these provisions in similar locations: The TWAIN
\par         Toolkit is distributed as is. The developer and distributors of the TWAIN Toolkit expressly disclaim all implied,
\par         express or statutory warranties including, without limitation, the implied warranties of merchantability, non
\par         infringement of third party rights and fitness for a particular purpose. Neither the developers nor the
\par         distributors will be liable for damages, whether direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential, as a

\par         Our fonts are free in the sense of the GPL. In short: Changing the font is allowed as long as the derivative
\par         work is published under the same license again. Pedantics keep claiming that the embedded use of GPL-fonts in
\par         i.e. PDFs requires the free publication of the PDF as well. This is why our GPL contains the so called "font

\par 
\par PREAMBLE The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of cooperative font
\par         projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide an open
\par         framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.
\par 
\par The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they are
\par         not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and
\par         sold with any software provided that the font names of derivative works are changed. The fonts and derivatives,
\par         however, cannot be released under any other type of license.

\par Clarification:
\par 
\par The GNU Lesser General Public License or LGPL is written for software libraries in the first place. We
\par             expressly want the LGPL to be valid for this artwork library too.
\par 
\par KDE Oxygen theme icons is a special kind of software library, it is an artwork library, it's elements
\par             can be used in a Graphical User Interface, or GUI.
\par 
\par Source code, for this library means:
\par 
\par where they exist, SVG;
\par 
\par otherwise, if applicable, the multi-layered formats xcf or psd, or otherwise png.
\par 
\par The LGPL in some sections obliges you to make the files carry notices. With images this is in some cases
\par             impossible or hardly useful.
\par 
\par With this library a notice is placed at a prominent place in the directory containing the elements. You
\par             may follow this practice.
\par 
\par The exception in section 5 of the GNU Lesser General Public License covers the use of elements of this

\par 
\par Version 3, 29 June 2007
\par 
\par Copyright \'a9 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
\par 
\par Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is
\par         not allowed.
\par 
\par This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of
\par         the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
\par 
\par ## 0. Additional Definitions.
\par 
\par As used herein, \'93this License\'94 refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the
\par         \'93GNU GPL\'94 refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
\par 
\par \'93The Library\'94 refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined
\par         Work as defined below.
\par 
\par An \'93Application\'94 is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not
\par         otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using
\par         an interface provided by the Library.
\par 
\par A \'93Combined Work\'94 is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The
\par         particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the \'93Linked
\par         Version\'94.
\par 
\par The \'93Minimal Corresponding Source\'94 for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined
\par         Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on
\par         the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
\par 
\par The \'93Corresponding Application Code\'94 for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for
\par         the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
\par         Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
\par 
\par ## 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
\par 
\par You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the
\par         GNU GPL.
\par 
\par ## 2. Conveying Modified Versions.
\par 
\par If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to
\par         be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is
\par         invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:
\par 
\par under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an
\par             Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part
\par             of its purpose remains meaningful, or
\par 
\par under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that
\par             copy.
\par 
\par ## 3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
\par 
\par The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the
\par         Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
\par         material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline
\par         functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
\par 
\par Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the
\par             Library and its use are covered by this License.
\par 
\par Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
\par 
\par ## 4. Combined Works.
\par 
\par You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict
\par         modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for
\par         debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:
\par 
\par Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the
\par             Library and its use are covered by this License.
\par 
\par Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
\par 
\par For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for
\par             the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and
\par             this license document.
\par 
\par Do one of the following:
\par                 Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding
\par                     Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or
\par                     relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined
\par                     Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is
\par                     one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system,
\par                     and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible
\par                     with the Linked Version.
\par 
\par Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding
\par                     Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or
\par                     relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined
\par                     Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
\par 
\par Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is
\par                     one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system,
\par                     and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible
\par                     with the Linked Version.
\par 
\par Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such
\par             information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to
\par             install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
\par             Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation
\par             Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use
\par             option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU
\par             GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)
\par 
\par ## 5. Combined Libraries.
\par 
\par You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library
\par         together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and
\par         convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:
\par 
\par Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any
\par             other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.
\par 
\par Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and
\par             explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
\par 
\par ## 6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
\par 
\par The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public
\par         License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ
\par         in detail to address new problems or concerns.
\par 
\par Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a
\par         certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License \'93or any later version\'94 applies to it, you
\par         have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version
\par         published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number
\par         of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License
\par         ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
\par 
\par If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU
\par         Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
\par         permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.
\par 
\par # GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
\par 
\par Version 2.1, February 1999
\par 
\par ## Preamble
\par 
\par The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast,
\par         the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
\par         make sure the software is free for all its users.
\par 
\par This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software
\par         packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can
\par         use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public
\par         License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
\par 
\par When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses
\par         are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
\par         service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the
\par         software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.
\par 
\par To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to
\par         ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
\par         distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
\par 
\par For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the
\par         recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
\par         code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so
\par         that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must
\par         show them these terms so they know their rights.
\par 
\par We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this
\par         license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
\par 
\par To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library.
\par         Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have
\par         is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that
\par         might be introduced by others.
\par 
\par Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure
\par         that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from
\par         a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
\par         consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
\par 
\par Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This
\par         license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different
\par         from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking
\par         those libraries into non-free programs.
\par 
\par When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of
\par         the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public
\par         License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser
\par         General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.
\par 
\par We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom
\par         than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage
\par         over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License
\par         for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.
\par 
\par For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a
\par         certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to
\par         use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free
\par         libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use
\par         the Lesser General Public License.
\par 
\par In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of
\par         people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free
\par         programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux
\par         operating system.
\par 
\par Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the
\par         user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using
\par         a modified version of the Library.
\par 
\par The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to
\par         the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains
\par         code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.
\par 
\par ## TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
\par 
\par 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a
\par         notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
\par         this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".
\par 
\par A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked
\par         with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
\par 
\par The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these
\par         terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that
\par         is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
\par         translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
\par         the term "modification".)
\par 
\par "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library,
\par         complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
\par         definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.
\par 
\par Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are
\par         outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a
\par         program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the
\par         Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program
\par         that uses the Library does.
\par 
\par 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you
\par         receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
\par         appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
\par         and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.
\par 
\par You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
\par         protection in exchange for a fee.
\par 
\par 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a
\par         work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
\par         above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
\par 
\par a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
\par 
\par b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you
\par             changed the files and the date of any change.
\par 
\par c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third
\par             parties under the terms of this License.
\par 
\par d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be
\par                 supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the
\par                 facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application
\par                 does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its
\par                 purpose remains meaningful.
\par                 (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely
\par                 well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
\par                 application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does
\par                 not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)
\par 
\par (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely
\par                 well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
\par                 application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does
\par                 not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)
\par 
\par These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not
\par         derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
\par         this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But
\par         when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution
\par         of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
\par         whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
\par 
\par Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely
\par         by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective
\par         works based on the Library.
\par 
\par In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work
\par         based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
\par         scope of this License.
\par 
\par 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of
\par         this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this
\par         License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.
\par         (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can
\par         specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.
\par 
\par Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General
\par         Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
\par 
\par This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a
\par         library.
\par 
\par 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section
\par         2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it
\par         with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
\par         Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.
\par 
\par If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering
\par         equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the
\par         source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
\par 
\par 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to
\par         work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
\par         work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this
\par         License.
\par 
\par However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative
\par         of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The
\par         executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such
\par         executables.
\par 
\par When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object
\par         code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is
\par         true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a
\par         library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
\par 
\par If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small
\par         macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is
\par         unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code
\par         plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)
\par 
\par Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under
\par         the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are
\par         linked directly with the Library itself.
\par 
\par 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses
\par         the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
\par         under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use
\par         and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.
\par 
\par You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the
\par         Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during
\par         execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well
\par         as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:
\par 
\par a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for
\par             the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1
\par             and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable
\par             "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library
\par             and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that
\par             the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to
\par             recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)
\par 
\par b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable
\par             mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer
\par             system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a
\par             modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
\par             interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
\par 
\par c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give
\par             the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
\par             performing this distribution.
\par 
\par d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated
\par             place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.
\par 
\par e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you
\par             have already sent this user a copy.
\par 
\par For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility
\par         programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be
\par         distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the
\par         major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless
\par         that component itself accompanies the executable.
\par 
\par It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that
\par         do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the
\par         Library together in an executable that you distribute.
\par 
\par 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a
\par         single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a
\par         combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other
\par         library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
\par 
\par a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library,
\par             uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections
\par             above.
\par 
\par b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a
\par             work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same
\par             work.
\par 
\par 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as
\par         expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
\par         distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
\par         parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
\par         terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
\par 
\par 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,
\par         nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions
\par         are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library
\par         (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms
\par         and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.
\par 
\par 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the
\par         recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify
\par         the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the
\par         recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
\par         parties with this License.
\par 
\par 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for
\par         any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
\par         agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
\par         conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
\par         this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at
\par         all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those
\par         who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
\par         License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
\par 
\par If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the
\par         balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
\par         circumstances.
\par 
\par It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims
\par         or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the
\par         free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
\par         generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
\par         application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
\par         software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
\par 
\par This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this
\par         License.
\par 
\par 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either
\par         by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this
\par         License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
\par         distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates
\par         the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
\par 
\par 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser
\par         General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
\par         but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
\par 
\par Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this
\par         License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
\par         either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does
\par         not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
\par         Foundation.
\par 
\par 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose
\par         distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software
\par         which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
\par         exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all
\par         derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
\par 
\par NO WARRANTY
\par 
\par 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY,
\par         TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
\par         OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
\par         BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE
\par         RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
\par         ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
\par 
\par 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY
\par         COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
\par         LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
\par         THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
\par         INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
\par         SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
\par 
\par ## END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
\par 
\par ## How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
\par 
\par If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend
\par         making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution
\par         under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).
\par 
\par To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start
\par         of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
\par         the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
\par 
\par Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
\par 
\par You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright
\par         disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
\par 
\par That's all there is to it!
\par 
\par # GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
\par 
\par Version 2, June 1991
\par 
\par ## Preamble
\par 
\par The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast,
\par         the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
\par         make sure the software is free for all its users.
\par 
\par This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially designated Free Software
\par         Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for your
\par         libraries, too.
\par 
\par When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are
\par         designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
\par         service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
\par         software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
\par 
\par To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask
\par         you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
\par         copies of the library, or if you modify it.
\par 
\par For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the
\par         recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
\par         code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients so that
\par         they can relink them with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must
\par         show them these terms so they know their rights.
\par 
\par Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this
\par         license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
\par 
\par Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no
\par         warranty for this free library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
\par         recipients to know that what they have is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by others
\par         will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
\par 
\par Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that
\par         companies distributing free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the
\par         program into proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for
\par         everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
\par 
\par Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License, which
\par         was designed for utility programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
\par         designated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and
\par         don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license.
\par 
\par The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually
\par         make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without
\par         changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to running a utility program
\par         or application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
\par         derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such.
\par 
\par Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License for libraries did not
\par         effectively promote software sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that
\par         weaker conditions might promote sharing better.
\par 
\par However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all benefit
\par         from the free status of the libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intended to permit
\par         developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of such programs
\par         to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve this as regards
\par         changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.)
\par         The hope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries.
\par 
\par The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to
\par         the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains
\par         code derived from the library, while the latter only works together with the library.
\par 
\par Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General Public License rather than by
\par         this special one.
\par 
\par ## TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
\par 
\par 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed by
\par         the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
\par         General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".
\par 
\par A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked
\par         with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
\par 
\par The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these
\par         terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that
\par         is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
\par         translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
\par         the term "modification".)
\par 
\par "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library,
\par         complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
\par         definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.
\par 
\par Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are
\par         outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a
\par         program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the
\par         Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program
\par         that uses the Library does.
\par 
\par 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you
\par         receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
\par         appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
\par         and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.
\par 
\par You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
\par         protection in exchange for a fee.
\par 
\par 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a
\par         work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
\par         above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
\par 
\par a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
\par 
\par b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you
\par             changed the files and the date of any change.
\par 
\par c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third
\par             parties under the terms of this License.
\par 
\par d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be
\par                 supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the
\par                 facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application
\par                 does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its
\par                 purpose remains meaningful.
\par                 (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely
\par                 well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
\par                 application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does
\par                 not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)
\par 
\par (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely
\par                 well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
\par                 application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does
\par                 not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)
\par 
\par These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not
\par         derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
\par         this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But
\par         when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution
\par         of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
\par         whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
\par 
\par Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely
\par         by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective
\par         works based on the Library.
\par 
\par In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work
\par         based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
\par         scope of this License.
\par 
\par 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of
\par         this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this
\par         License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.
\par         (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can
\par         specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.
\par 
\par Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General
\par         Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
\par 
\par This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a
\par         library.
\par 
\par 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section
\par         2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it
\par         with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
\par         Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.
\par 
\par If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering
\par         equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the
\par         source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
\par 
\par 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to
\par         work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
\par         work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this
\par         License.
\par 
\par However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative
\par         of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The
\par         executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such
\par         executables.
\par 
\par When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object
\par         code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is
\par         true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a
\par         library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
\par 
\par If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small
\par         macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is
\par         unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code
\par         plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)
\par 
\par Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under
\par         the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are
\par         linked directly with the Library itself.
\par 
\par 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a "work that uses
\par         the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
\par         under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use
\par         and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.
\par 
\par You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the
\par         Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during
\par         execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well
\par         as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:
\par 
\par a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for
\par             the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1
\par             and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable
\par             "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library
\par             and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that
\par             the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to
\par             recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)
\par 
\par b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give
\par             the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
\par             performing this distribution.
\par 
\par c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated
\par             place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.
\par 
\par d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you
\par             have already sent this user a copy.
\par 
\par For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility
\par         programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the source code
\par         distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the
\par         major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless
\par         that component itself accompanies the executable.
\par 
\par It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that
\par         do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the
\par         Library together in an executable that you distribute.
\par 
\par 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a
\par         single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a
\par         combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other
\par         library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
\par 
\par a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library,
\par             uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections
\par             above.
\par 
\par b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a
\par             work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same
\par             work.
\par 
\par 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as
\par         expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
\par         distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
\par         parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
\par         terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
\par 
\par 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,
\par         nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions
\par         are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library
\par         (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms
\par         and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.
\par 
\par 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the
\par         recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify
\par         the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the
\par         recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
\par         parties to this License.
\par 
\par 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for
\par         any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
\par         agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
\par         conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
\par         this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at
\par         all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those
\par         who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
\par         License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
\par 
\par If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the
\par         balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
\par         circumstances.
\par 
\par It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims
\par         or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the
\par         free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
\par         generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
\par         application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
\par         software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
\par 
\par This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this
\par         License.
\par 
\par 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either
\par         by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this
\par         License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
\par         distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates
\par         the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
\par 
\par 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Library
\par         General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
\par         but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
\par 
\par Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this
\par         License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
\par         either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does
\par         not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
\par         Foundation.
\par 
\par 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose
\par         distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software
\par         which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
\par         exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all
\par         derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
\par 
\par NO WARRANTY
\par 
\par 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY,
\par         TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
\par         OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
\par         BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE
\par         RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
\par         ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
\par 
\par 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY
\par         COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
\par         LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
\par         THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
\par         INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
\par         SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
\par 
\par ## END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
\par 
\par ## How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
\par 
\par If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend
\par         making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution
\par         under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).
\par 
\par To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start
\par         of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
\par         the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
\par 
\par Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
\par 
\par You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright
\par         disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
\par 
\par That's all there is to it!
\par 
\par # GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
\par 
\par Version 3, 29 June 2007
\par 
\par Copyright \'a9 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
\par 
\par Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is
\par         not allowed.
\par 
\par ### Preamble
\par 
\par The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.
\par 
\par The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and
\par         change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share
\par         and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free
\par         Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other
\par         work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.
\par 
\par When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are
\par         designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if
\par         you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use
\par         pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
\par 
\par To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender
\par         the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you
\par         modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
\par 
\par For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to
\par         the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
\par         source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
\par 
\par Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software,
\par         and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
\par 
\par For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this
\par         free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed,
\par         so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.
\par 
\par Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside
\par         them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users'
\par         freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for
\par         individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version
\par         of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains,
\par         we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect
\par         the freedom of users.
\par 
\par Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to
\par         restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid
\par         the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent
\par         this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
\par 
\par The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
\par 
\par ### TERMS AND CONDITIONS
\par 
\par \'93This License\'94 refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
\par 
\par \'93Copyright\'94 also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor
\par         masks.
\par 
\par \'93The Program\'94 refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed
\par         as \'93you\'94. \'93Licensees\'94 and \'93recipients\'94 may be individuals or organizations.
\par 
\par To \'93modify\'94 a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright
\par         permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \'93modified version\'94 of
\par         the earlier work or a work \'93based on\'94 the earlier work.
\par 
\par A \'93covered work\'94 means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.
\par 
\par To \'93propagate\'94 a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or
\par         secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or
\par         modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making
\par         available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.
\par 
\par To \'93convey\'94 a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies.
\par         Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
\par 
\par An interactive user interface displays \'93Appropriate Legal Notices\'94 to the extent that it includes a
\par         convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the
\par         user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees
\par         may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a
\par         list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
\par 
\par The \'93source code\'94 for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.
\par         \'93Object code\'94 means any non-source form of a work.
\par 
\par A \'93Standard Interface\'94 means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized
\par         standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
\par         widely used among developers working in that language.
\par 
\par The \'93System Libraries\'94 of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a)
\par         is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component,
\par         and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface
\par         for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \'93Major Component\'94, in this
\par         context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
\par         (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code
\par         interpreter used to run it.
\par 
\par The \'93Corresponding Source\'94 for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate,
\par         install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control
\par         those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or
\par         generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not
\par         part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source
\par         files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work
\par         is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
\par         subprograms and other parts of the work.
\par 
\par The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts
\par         of the Corresponding Source.
\par 
\par The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.
\par 
\par All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are
\par         irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission
\par         to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the
\par         output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or
\par         other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
\par 
\par You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your
\par         license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them
\par         make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that
\par         you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.
\par         Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your
\par         direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside
\par         their relationship with you.
\par 
\par Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing
\par         is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.
\par 
\par No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law
\par         fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar
\par         laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.
\par 
\par When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures
\par         to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the
\par         covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of
\par         enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
\par         technological measures.
\par 
\par You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
\par         you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all
\par         notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
\par         code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License
\par         along with the Program.
\par 
\par You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty
\par         protection for a fee.
\par 
\par You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form
\par         of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
\par 
\par a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.
\par 
\par b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any
\par             conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \'93keep intact
\par             all notices\'94.
\par 
\par c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession
\par             of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the
\par             whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission
\par             to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately
\par             received it.
\par 
\par d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however,
\par             if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not
\par             make them do so.
\par 
\par A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature
\par         extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a
\par         volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \'93aggregate\'94 if the compilation and its resulting
\par         copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the
\par         individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to
\par         the other parts of the aggregate.
\par 
\par You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you
\par         also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these
\par         ways:
\par 
\par a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution
\par             medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for
\par             software interchange.
\par 
\par b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution
\par             medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer
\par             spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either
\par             (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License,
\par             on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your
\par             reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding
\par             Source from a network server at no charge.
\par 
\par c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the
\par             Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you
\par             received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.
\par 
\par d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and
\par             offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further
\par             charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the
\par             place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server
\par             (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear
\par             directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server
\par             hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed
\par             to satisfy these requirements.
\par 
\par e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the
\par             object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under
\par             subsection 6d.
\par 
\par A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a
\par         System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.
\par 
\par A \'93User Product\'94 is either (1) a \'93consumer product\'94, which means any tangible personal property
\par         which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
\par         incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be
\par         resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, \'93normally used\'94
\par         refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or
\par         of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product
\par         is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer
\par         uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.
\par 
\par \'93Installation Information\'94 for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or
\par         other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
\par         a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
\par         functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification
\par         has been made.
\par 
\par If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User
\par         Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User
\par         Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is
\par         characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation
\par         Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to
\par         install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).
\par 
\par The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide
\par         support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
\par         the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the
\par         modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
\par         protocols for communication across the network.
\par 
\par Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in
\par         a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form),
\par         and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.
\par 
\par \'93Additional permissions\'94 are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from
\par         one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be
\par         treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.
\par         If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those
\par         permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional
\par         permissions.
\par 
\par When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that
\par         copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain
\par         cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered
\par         work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
\par 
\par Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if
\par         authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
\par 
\par a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this
\par             License; or
\par 
\par b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material
\par             or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or
\par 
\par c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of
\par             such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
\par 
\par d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or
\par 
\par e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service
\par             marks; or
\par 
\par f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the
\par             material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any
\par             liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.
\par 
\par All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \'93further restrictions\'94 within the meaning of
\par         section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed
\par         by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license
\par         document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to
\par         a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction
\par         does not survive such relicensing or conveying.
\par 
\par If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source
\par         files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the
\par         applicable terms.
\par 
\par Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license,
\par         or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.
\par 
\par You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
\par         otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License
\par         (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).
\par 
\par However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is
\par         reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your
\par         license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable
\par         means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
\par 
\par Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder
\par         notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of
\par         violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30
\par         days after your receipt of the notice.
\par 
\par Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received
\par         copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
\par         reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.
\par 
\par You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary
\par         propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a
\par         copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to
\par         propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.
\par         Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
\par         so.
\par 
\par Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
\par         licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for
\par         enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
\par 
\par An \'93entity transaction\'94 is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all
\par         assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work
\par         results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also
\par         receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous
\par         paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest,
\par         if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
\par 
\par You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this
\par         License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted
\par         under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
\par         alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the
\par         Program or any portion of it.
\par 
\par A \'93contributor\'94 is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on
\par         which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \'93contributor version\'94.
\par 
\par A contributor's \'93essential patent claims\'94 are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor,
\par         whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this
\par         License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be
\par         infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this
\par         definition, \'93control\'94 includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the
\par         requirements of this License.
\par 
\par Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's
\par         essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the
\par         contents of its contributor version.
\par 
\par In the following three paragraphs, a \'93patent license\'94 is any express agreement or commitment, however
\par         denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue
\par         for patent infringement). To \'93grant\'94 such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or
\par         commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.
\par 
\par If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the
\par         work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
\par         publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the
\par         Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent
\par         license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License,
\par         to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \'93Knowingly relying\'94 means you have actual knowledge
\par         that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the
\par         covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason
\par         to believe are valid.
\par 
\par If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by
\par         procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the
\par         covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the
\par         patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on
\par         it.
\par 
\par A patent license is \'93discriminatory\'94 if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits
\par         the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically
\par         granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third
\par         party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based
\par         on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
\par         parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with
\par         copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in
\par         connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that
\par         arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
\par 
\par Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to
\par         infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
\par 
\par If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the
\par         conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a
\par         covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
\par         obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that
\par         obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way
\par         you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the
\par         Program.
\par 
\par Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work
\par         with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and
\par         to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered
\par         work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction
\par         through a network will apply to the combination as such.
\par 
\par The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from
\par         time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
\par         address new problems or concerns.
\par 
\par Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered
\par         version of the GNU General Public License \'93or any later version\'94 applies to it, you have the option of
\par         following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the
\par         Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License,
\par         you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
\par 
\par If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can
\par         be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that
\par         version for the Program.
\par 
\par Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations
\par         are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.
\par 
\par THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
\par         STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \'93AS IS\'94 WITHOUT WARRANTY
\par         OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
\par         MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
\par         PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
\par         OR CORRECTION.
\par 
\par IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY
\par         OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING
\par         ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
\par         PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
\par         OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
\par         PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
\par 
\par If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect
\par         according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute
\par         waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability
\par         accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.
\par 
\par END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
\par 
\par ### How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
\par 
\par If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way
\par         to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
\par 
\par To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each
\par         source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
\par         \'93copyright\'94 line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
\par 
\par Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
\par 
\par If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an

\par 
\par The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public
\par         License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \'93about
\par         box\'94.
\par 
\par You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \'93copyright

\par The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your
\par         program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
\par         with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this
\par         License. But first, please read <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.

\par # GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
\par 
\par Version 2, June 1991
\par 
\par ### Preamble
\par 
\par The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast,
\par         the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make
\par         sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
\par         Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software
\par         Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your
\par         programs, too.
\par 
\par When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are
\par         designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
\par         service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
\par         software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
\par 
\par To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask
\par         you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
\par         copies of the software, or if you modify it.
\par 
\par For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the
\par         recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
\par         And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
\par 
\par We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which
\par         gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.
\par 
\par Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is
\par         no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
\par         recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not
\par         reflect on the original authors' reputations.
\par 
\par Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that
\par         redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
\par         proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or
\par         not licensed at all.
\par 
\par The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
\par 
\par ### TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
\par 
\par 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the
\par         copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program",
\par         below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
\par         derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
\par         verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included
\par         without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
\par 
\par Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are
\par         outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered
\par         only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the
\par         Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
\par 
\par 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive
\par         it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
\par         copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
\par         absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the
\par         Program.
\par 
\par You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
\par         protection in exchange for a fee.
\par 
\par 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a
\par         work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
\par         above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
\par 
\par These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not
\par         derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
\par         this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But
\par         when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution
\par         of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
\par         whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
\par 
\par Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely
\par         by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective
\par         works based on the Program.
\par 
\par In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work
\par         based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
\par         scope of this License.
\par 
\par 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in
\par         object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
\par         following:
\par 
\par The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an
\par         executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
\par         associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
\par         executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
\par         normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)
\par         of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
\par         executable.
\par 
\par If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place,
\par         then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the
\par         source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
\par 
\par 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly
\par         provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
\par         void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
\par         copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
\par         remain in full compliance.
\par 
\par 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,
\par         nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions
\par         are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program
\par         (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms
\par         and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
\par 
\par 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient
\par         automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject
\par         to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
\par         rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
\par 
\par 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any
\par         other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
\par         or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of
\par         this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
\par         any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example,
\par         if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
\par         directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
\par         refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
\par 
\par If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the
\par         balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
\par         circumstances.
\par 
\par It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims
\par         or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the
\par         free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
\par         generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
\par         application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
\par         software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
\par 
\par This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this
\par         License.
\par 
\par 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either
\par         by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
\par         License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
\par         distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates
\par         the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
\par 
\par 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General
\par         Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
\par         differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
\par 
\par Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this
\par         License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
\par         either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does
\par         not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
\par         Foundation.
\par 
\par 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose
\par         distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
\par         copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
\par         exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all
\par         derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
\par 
\par NO WARRANTY
\par 
\par 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM,
\par         TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
\par         OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
\par         BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE
\par         RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
\par         ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
\par 
\par 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY
\par         COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
\par         LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
\par         THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
\par         INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
\par         PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
\par 
\par ### END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
\par 
\par ### How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
\par 
\par If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way
\par         to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
\par 
\par To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each
\par         source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
\par         "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
\par 
\par Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
\par 
\par If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive
\par         mode:
\par 
\par The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts
\par         of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show
\par         w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
\par         program.
\par 
\par You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright
\par         disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
\par 
\par This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your
\par         program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
\par         with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU
\par         Lesser General Public License instead of this License.
\par 
\par # Common Public License Version 1.0 (CPL)
\par 
\par THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY
\par         USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
\par 
\par 1. DEFINITIONS
\par 
\par "Contribution" means:
\par 
\par a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this
\par             Agreement, and
\par 
\par b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
\par 
\par i) changes to the Program, and
\par 
\par ii) additions to the Program;
\par 
\par where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that
\par             particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
\par             such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include
\par             additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the
\par             Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
\par 
\par "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
\par 
\par "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by
\par         the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.
\par 
\par "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
\par 
\par "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all
\par         Contributors.
\par 
\par 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
\par 
\par a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive,
\par             worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
\par             publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
\par             derivative works, in source code and object code form.
\par 
\par b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive,
\par             worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and
\par             otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This
\par             patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the
\par             Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
\par             covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include
\par             the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
\par 
\par c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set
\par             forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent
\par             or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
\par             Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or
\par             otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
\par             assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example,
\par             if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's
\par             responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
\par 
\par d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its
\par             Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
\par 
\par 3. REQUIREMENTS
\par 
\par A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement,
\par         provided that:
\par 
\par a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
\par 
\par b) its license agreement:
\par 
\par i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and
\par             implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
\par             conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
\par 
\par ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct,
\par             indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
\par 
\par iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor
\par             alone and not by any other party; and
\par 
\par iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs
\par             licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
\par             exchange.
\par 
\par When the Program is made available in source code form:
\par 
\par a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
\par 
\par b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
\par 
\par Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.
\par 
\par Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that
\par         reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
\par 
\par 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
\par 
\par Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users,
\par         business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
\par         the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does
\par         not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a
\par         commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
\par         every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively
\par         "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the
\par         Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
\par         connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this
\par         section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
\par         infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
\par         Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with
\par         the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor
\par         may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
\par 
\par For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That
\par         Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or
\par         offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial
\par         Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims
\par         against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any
\par         other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
\par 
\par 5. NO WARRANTY
\par 
\par EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
\par         WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES
\par         OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient
\par         is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
\par         risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and
\par         costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
\par         unavailability or interruption of operations.
\par 
\par 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
\par 
\par EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY
\par         LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT
\par         LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,
\par         OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR
\par         THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
\par 
\par 7. GENERAL
\par 
\par If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
\par         the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by
\par         the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
\par         valid and enforceable.
\par 
\par If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to
\par         software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that
\par         Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In
\par         addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
\par         in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
\par         hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall
\par         terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
\par 
\par All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the
\par         material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time
\par         after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient
\par         agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's
\par         obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
\par         and survive.
\par

\par 
\par ## 2. Source Code License.
\par 
\par ### 2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.
\par 
\par The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third
\par     party intellectual property claims:
\par 
\par under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable
\par         by Initial Developer to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original Code
\par         (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
\par 
\par under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or selling of Original
\par         Code, to make, have made, use, practice, sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original
\par         Code (or portions thereof).
\par 
\par the licenses granted in this Section 2.1 (a) and (b) are effective on the date
\par         Initial Developer first distributes Original Code under the terms of this License.
\par 
\par Notwithstanding Section 2.1 (b) above,
\par         no patent license is granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2) separate from the Original
\par         Code; or 3) for infringements caused by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the combination of the
\par         Original Code with other software or devices.
\par 
\par ### 2.2. Contributor Grant.
\par 
\par Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide,
\par     royalty-free, non-exclusive license
\par 
\par under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable
\par         by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications
\par         created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as
\par         Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
\par 
\par under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of
\par         Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or
\par         portions of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1)
\par         Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of Modifications made by
\par         that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination).
\par 
\par the licenses granted in Sections 2.2 (a) and 2.2 (b) are effective on the date
\par         Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered Code.
\par 
\par Notwithstanding Section 2.2 (b) above,
\par         no patent license is granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; 2)
\par         separate from the Contributor Version; 3) for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of
\par         Contributor Version or ii) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software
\par         (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered
\par         Code in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.
\par 
\par ## 3. Distribution Obligations.
\par 
\par ### 3.1. Application of License.
\par 
\par The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License,
\par     including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered
\par     Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under
\par     Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of
\par     the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or
\par     restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an
\par     additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.
\par 
\par ### 3.2. Availability of Source Code.
\par 
\par Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under
\par     the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic
\par     Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via
\par     Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
\par     initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
\par     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains
\par     available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
\par 
\par ### 3.3. Description of Modifications.
\par 
\par You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to
\par     create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification
\par     is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of
\par     the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related
\par     documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
\par 
\par ### 3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
\par 
\par If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to
\par     exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled
\par     "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know
\par     whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in
\par     Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
\par     Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or
\par     newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been
\par     obtained.
\par 
\par If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of
\par     patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include
\par     this information in the legal file.
\par 
\par Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4 (a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's
\par     original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
\par 
\par ### 3.5. Required Notices.
\par 
\par You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code.
\par     If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must
\par     include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a
\par     notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described
\par     in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the
\par     Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to
\par     offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
\par     Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
\par     Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation
\par     is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
\par     liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
\par     liability terms You offer.
\par 
\par ### 3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
\par 
\par You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the
\par     Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of
\par     how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice
\par     must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which
\par     You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
\par     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
\par     provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version
\par     does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in
\par     this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear
\par     that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
\par     Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
\par     by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
\par 
\par ### 3.7. Larger Works.
\par 
\par You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License
\par     and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this
\par     License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
\par 
\par ## 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
\par 
\par If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the
\par     Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
\par     to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be
\par     included in the legal file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
\par     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of
\par     ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
\par 
\par ## 5. Application of this License.
\par 
\par This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
\par 
\par ## 6. Versions of the License.
\par 
\par ### 6.1. New Versions
\par 
\par Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from
\par     time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
\par 
\par ### 6.2. Effect of New Versions
\par 
\par Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use
\par     it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent
\par     version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms
\par     applicable to Covered Code created under this License.
\par 
\par ### 6.3. Derivative Works
\par 
\par If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code
\par     which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases
\par     "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
\par     license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your
\par     version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License.
\par     (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)
\par 
\par ## 7. Disclaimer of warranty
\par 
\par Covered code is provided under this license on an "as is" basis, without warranty of
\par     any kind, either expressed or implied, including, without limitation, warranties that the covered code is free of
\par     defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and
\par     performance of the covered code is with you. Should any covered code prove defective in any respect, you (not the
\par     initial developer or any other contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair or correction. This
\par     disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this license. No use of any covered code is authorized
\par     hereunder except under this disclaimer.
\par 
\par ## 8. Termination
\par 
\par 8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if
\par     You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
\par     All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License.
\par     Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.
\par 
\par 8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding
\par     declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor
\par     against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:
\par 
\par such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any
\par         patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60
\par         days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You
\par         either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and
\par         future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
\par         the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment
\par         arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn,
\par         the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or
\par         2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period
\par         specified above.
\par 
\par any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor
\par         Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under
\par         Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are
\par         revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by
\par         that Participant.
\par 
\par 8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such
\par     Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
\par     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of
\par     the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
\par     license.
\par 
\par 8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements
\par     (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to
\par     termination shall survive termination.
\par 
\par ## 9. Limitation of liability
\par 
\par Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
\par     negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall you, the initial developer, any other contributor, or any distributor of
\par     covered code, or any supplier of any of such parties, be liable to any person for any indirect, special,
\par     incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill,
\par     work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such
\par     party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to
\par     liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law
\par     prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
\par     consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to you.
\par 
\par ## 10. U.S. government end users
\par 
\par The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software
\par     documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
\par     1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June
\par     1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.
\par 
\par ## 11. Miscellaneous
\par 
\par This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this
\par     License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
\par     enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
\par     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one
\par     party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any
\par     litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
\par     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for
\par     costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of
\par     the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
\par     regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to
\par     this License.
\par 
\par ## 12. Responsibility for claims
\par 
\par As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising,
\par     directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial
\par     Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
\par     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
\par 
\par ## 13. Multiple-licensed code
\par 
\par Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as "Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means
\par     that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the
\par     MPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in
\par     Exhibit A.
\par 
\par ## Exhibit A - Mozilla Public License.
\par 
\par NOTE: The text of this Exhibit A may differ slightly from the text of the notices in the Source Code files of
\par     the Original Code. You should use the text of this Exhibit A rather than the text found in the Original Code Source
\par     Code for Your Modifications.

\par ### 2.4. Subsequent Licenses
\par 
\par No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a
\par     subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under

\par 
\par ### 2.5. Representation

\par 
\par This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair
\par     dealing, or other equivalents.
\par 
\par ### 2.7. Conditions
\par 
\par Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.
\par 
\par ## 3. Responsibilities
\par 
\par ### 3.1. Distribution of Source Form
\par 
\par All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to
\par     which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
\par     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License.
\par     You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients\'b4 rights in the Source Code Form.
\par 
\par ### 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
\par 
\par If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
\par 
\par such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and
\par             You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
\par             reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient;
\par             and
\par 
\par such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and
\par             You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
\par             reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient;
\par             and
\par 
\par You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under
\par             different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
\par             recipients\'b4 rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
\par 
\par You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under
\par             different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
\par             recipients\'b4 rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
\par 
\par ### 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
\par 
\par You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the
\par     requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with
\par     a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary
\par     Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such
\par     Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
\par     Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).
\par 
\par ### 3.4. Notices
\par 
\par You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices,
\par     disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
\par     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual
\par     inaccuracies.
\par 
\par ### 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
\par 
\par You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one
\par     or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any
\par     Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation
\par     is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such
\par     Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
\par     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.
\par 
\par ## 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
\par 
\par If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the
\par     Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this
\par     License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
\par     must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to
\par     the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of
\par     ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
\par 
\par ## 5. Termination
\par 
\par 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its
\par     terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
\par     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants,
\par     and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means
\par     prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are
\par     reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means,
\par     this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You
\par     become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.
\par 
\par 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding
\par     declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
\par     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered
\par     Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
\par 
\par 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding
\par     distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
\par     termination shall survive termination.
\par 
\par ## 6. Disclaimer of Warranty
\par 
\par Covered Software is provided under this License on an \'93as is\'94 basis, without warranty of any kind,
\par     either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is
\par     free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality
\par     and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,
\par     You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of
\par     warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this
\par     License except under this disclaimer.
\par 
\par ## 7. Limitation of Liability
\par 
\par Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or
\par     otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You
\par     for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without
\par     limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and
\par     all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such
\par     damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
\par     party\'b4s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the
\par     exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to
\par     You.
\par 
\par ## 8. Litigation
\par 
\par Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant
\par     maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction,
\par     without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party\'b4s ability to
\par     bring cross-claims or counter-claims.
\par 
\par ## 9. Miscellaneous
\par 
\par This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this
\par     License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
\par     enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
\par     drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
\par 
\par ## 10. Versions of the License
\par 
\par ### 10.1. New Versions
\par 
\par Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license
\par     steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
\par     distinguishing version number.
\par 
\par ### 10.2. Effect of New Versions
\par 
\par You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally
\par     received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.
\par 
\par ### 10.3. Modified Versions
\par 
\par If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you
\par     may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the
\par     name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).
\par

\par # SIL Open Font
\par     License Version 1.1 \endash  26 February 2007
\par 
\par PREAMBLE The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of collaborative font
\par     projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
\par     open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.
\par 
\par The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they are not
\par     sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold
\par     with any software provided that the font names of derivative works are changed. The fonts and derivatives, however,
\par     cannot be released under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not
\par     apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
\par 
\par DEFINITIONS "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright Holder(s) under this license
\par     and clearly marked as such. This may include source files, build scripts and documentation.
\par 
\par "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the copyright statement(s).
\par 
\par "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as distributed by the Copyright
\par     Holder(s).
\par 
\par "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting, or substituting \endash  in part or in whole
\par     -- any of the components of the Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a new
\par     environment.
\par 
\par "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical writer or other person who contributed to the
\par     Font Software.
\par 
\par PERMISSION & CONDITIONS Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of the
\par     Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify, redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of
\par     the Font Software, subject to the following conditions:
\par 
\par 1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components, in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold
\par     by itself.
\par 
\par 2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled, redistributed and/or sold with any
\par     software, provided that each copy contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be included
\par     either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields
\par     within text or binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.
\par 
\par 3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font Name(s) unless explicit written permission
\par     is granted by the corresponding Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
\par     presented to the users.
\par 
\par 4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font Software shall not be used to promote,
\par     endorse or advertise any Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and
\par     the Author(s) or with their explicit written permission.
\par 
\par 5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be distributed entirely under this
\par     license, and must not be distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this
\par     license does not apply to any document created using the Font Software.
\par 
\par TERMINATION This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are not met.
\par 
\par DISCLAIMER THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING
\par     BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF
\par     COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM,
\par     DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER

\par         purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works
\par         that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such

\par 
\par 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution
\par     intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

\par     determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your
\par     exercise of permissions under this License.
\par 
\par 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including

\par     act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if
\par     You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims
\par     asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

\par         phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
\par         considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
\par 
\par "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and
\par         anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works
\par         listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute
\par         intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more
\par         other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are
\par         assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation
\par         (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.

\par For the avoidance of doubt:Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right
\par                 to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the
\par                 Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights

\par                 collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor

\par                 under this License; and,Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties,
\par                 whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
\par                 administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
\par                 granted under this License.
\par 
\par For the avoidance of doubt:
\par 
\par Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right
\par                 to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the
\par                 Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
\par                 granted under this License;
\par 
\par Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to
\par                 collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor

\par                 granted under this License.
\par 
\par The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above
\par     rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
\par     media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
\par 
\par 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and
\par     limited by the following restrictions:
\par 
\par You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a
\par         copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute
\par         or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License
\par         or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
\par         the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
\par         to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You
\par         Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work
\par         that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
\par         under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this
\par         does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If
\par         You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
\par         Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from
\par         any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section
\par         4(c), as requested.
\par 
\par You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a
\par         later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons
\par         jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this
\par         License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the
\par         Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you
\par         license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable
\par         License"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I)
\par         You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You
\par         Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the
\par         terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights
\par         granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices
\par         that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as
\par         included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the
\par         Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability
\par         of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
\par         the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this
\par         does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the
\par         Applicable License.
\par 
\par If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a
\par         request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,
\par         reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
\par         applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties
\par         (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's
\par         copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the
\par         title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
\par         specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
\par         information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit
\par         identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author,"
\par         or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be
\par         implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a
\par         minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection
\par         appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other
\par         contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the
\par         purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may
\par         not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original
\par         Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the
\par         separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
\par 
\par Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law,
\par         if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
\par         Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work
\par         which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
\par         jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the
\par         right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
\par         action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as
\par         appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
\par         reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
\par         otherwise.
\par 
\par 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
\par 
\par UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
\par     REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
\par     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE
\par     ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
\par     SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
\par 
\par 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
\par     LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
\par     DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
\par     SUCH DAMAGES.
\par 
\par 7. Termination
\par 
\par This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the
\par         terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this
\par         License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
\par         compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this
\par         License.
\par 
\par Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the
\par         applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
\par         under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
\par         election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be,
\par         granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless
\par         terminated as stated above.
\par 
\par 8. Miscellaneous
\par 
\par Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient
\par         a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
\par 
\par Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
\par         the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
\par 
\par If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the
\par         validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
\par         parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
\par         provision valid and enforceable.
\par 
\par No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver
\par         or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
\par 
\par This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here.
\par         There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here.
\par         Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This
\par         License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
\par 
\par The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the
\par         terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September
\par         28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
\par         Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject
\par         matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according
\par         to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national
\par         law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not
\par         granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is
\par         not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

\par Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
\par 
\par Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights
\par         holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other
\par         rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only,
\par         are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
\par 
\par Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for
\par         use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright
\par         and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and
\par         conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary
\par         before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly
\par         mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under
\par         an exception or limitation to copyright. More
\par             considerations for licensors.
\par 
\par Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
\par         licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and
\par         conditions. If the licensor\rquote s permission is not necessary for any reason\endash for example, because of any applicable
\par         exception or limitation to copyright\endash then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only
\par         permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the
\par         licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other
\par         rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or
\par         described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where
\par         reasonable. More
\par             considerations for the public.

\par By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions
\par         of this Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
\par         extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in

\par             Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and
\par             Similar Rights.
\par 
\par Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of
\par             proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO
